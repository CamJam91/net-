#Layer 1 -Hub: single collision: ports are non segmented
	horizontal only
#Layer 2 -Switch: multiple collision: ports are segmented
	heirarchical

#Layer 3 -Routers: also called a layer 3 switch. A switch by nature but connects networks,(domains): interdomain connections. doesn't do internal. They memorize IP addresses (logical address) unlike MAC addresses with a switch

	Each domain has its own router. And each has at least one for internal and external.

	If machines want to talk to eachother and they are internetwork they don't leave the network. Router is not used. 
	Routing table: routers hace a small database that colledc the addressis in its Domain. 
	Routers have cpu, ram and hd
Default gateway IP is the same as router, usually networkid.1

127.0.0.1: loopback test
Metric: measure the "cost" of navigating through a network.
Bay: a slot in a router machine where extension cards can make the router serve different purposes.

Class A 1-126 1 block
Class B 128-191 2 block
Class C 192-223 3 block
NAT: network address translation used to distinguish between public and private IP addresses. Uses a NAT forwarding table.

PAT: Port address translation
Well known port numbers: 0-1023
Registered port numbers: 1024-49151
Dynamic ports: 49152-65535

Static routing: non changing routes
dynamic routing:
