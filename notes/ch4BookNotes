## Ethernet standards

	##100 megabit ethernet
100BASE-t //coloquially called fast ethernet, 100 meter distance, cat5 or better utp or stp cabling

Baseband - only one signal can occupy the wire at a time (the lowest) 

100BASE-FX //Fiber optic cabling. runs at 100 megabit, baseband, 2 km distance
Advantages over UTP: more secure, resistant to emi, and longer range

100BASE-SX: short distance led cables, alternative to fiber cables **depricated*

 **100Base tech is outdated and will only be worked on in the field for legacy tech

DUPLEX: half-duplex routers could only sned or recieve data at one time not both full duplex does both. All routers today are full duplaex. 

	##gigabit ethernet
	Thats 1K BASE
1000BASE-T
These cables have the same distance as 100BASE (100 meters) and use the same cable connectors
	-1000BASE-SX: multimode that transfers led light on a fiber cable, uses LC connectors

1000BASE-LX Long distance (5KM)

Fiber connectors: SFF (small form factor): a type of SFF call MT-RJ is used by cisco. 
Local connectors (LC) very popular in the US


##Connectors
GBIC: Standard for modular ethernet plugs. They have a transceiver that can swap types today SFP is used.
