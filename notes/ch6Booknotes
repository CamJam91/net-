## TCP/IP  protocol suite:
	##Network layer
	Internet protocol: works at the network layer. Takes the payload ans adds the ip packet then sends to the datalink layer
	--IPv4 and IPv6 are both protocols on the network layer
	**ICMP(internet control message protocol) is also a protocol on the network layer --ping uses this
	-A few parts of the packet -Version: 4 or 6 -total length: size in octets, 65kb is the max -time to live: number that decrements by 1 every hop to limit packets from infinitley looping -protocol: usually tcp or udp

	##Transport layer
		##TCP
	- 3 way handshake is syn, syn-ack, ack
	- data get segmented
	- simplified header: source ports, destination port, sequence number ,ak number: used to keep track of segmented parts
	flags: or tcp flags, give both sides detailed info about state of connection
	checksum: tcps error checking formula

		##UDP
	- faster when compared to TCP
	- Dynamic host control protocol and domain name system use UDP
	- UDP header: Source port, destination port, length and checksum
	-UDP has checksum like tcp but no seq and ak numbers
	-Does not get chopped up like tcp

	##Application
		##Uses various protocols to send data between client and server. An example is http


	##Ip addresses in networks: Host Id: denoted by an x in an ip address ex: 202.120.10.x it specifies an actual machine
	Default gateway: for data to be routed outside of LANs it needs a router which is called the default gateway
	Routing table: what the router uses to direct addresses
