##Ethernet
IEEE 802.3
To prevent collisions, CSMA/CD is used (Carrier -sesne with mutiple access/ collision detection)
CSMA/CA (collision avoidance) used fro wireless

	Hubs: single collision domain --- single point of failure, one port has access to all others
	switch: multiple collision domain --- ports don't have access to eachother
	2 layers: logical link control: IP adress
		media access control: physical system identification
	hub vs switch: switch is faster by at least tenfold
		hubs work at layer 1 switches work at layer 2
	Router: layer 3 switch

## security
	-sniffer analyes protocols
	-have more expensive and powerful hardware versions


##Cables: the T in BASET is twisted pair: all twisted pair cable have maximum length of 100 meters or 328 feet
CAt 3 = 16mbps
CAT 4 = 20
CAT 5 = 100
Cat 5E = 1000 
CAT 6 = 10000 (10G)
CAT7 = 28gbps
CAT 8 = 40 GBPS
E = enhanced

568A to 568A or 568b to 568b is a patch cable/ straight through cable: used for connecting non-similar devices: Pc to switch or hub
568A to 568B is a crossover cable: connects simlar devices: hub to hub, switch to switch pc to pc



Multimode fiber: plastic instead of glass, led instead of laser: more durable and cheaper but less efficient
single mode fiber: glass and laser: expensive and fragile but more expensive
layer 2 < data link < MAC address < switch/bridge

Bridge: similar to switch is like an address book for networking

Auto sensing: when a switch can automatically figure the speed of connections and change accordingly

STP: spanning tree protocol prevents loopoing of data

100BASET aka fast ethernet aka standard ethernet

SONET: synchronous optical network download speed is the same as upload speed maxes out at 250 GBPS

1000BASET modern ethernet
