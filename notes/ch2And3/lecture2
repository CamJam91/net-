	TOPOLOGY
Databus easy to setup, difficult to trouble shoot,
	single point of failure. 

Modulation, each piece of a network can work independant of another


star topology

These use hubs
No single point of failure
	except hub
Low cost
limited on number of computers # of ports

Star-Bus (hybrid)
Could be a star network connected to other networks using a bus and so on
most used

Token ring

Only the machine who has the token can transmit data, token passes
no collision and heavy payload (package)
Highly reliable, very low failures
They used this for metro area networks
cost was high
used by IBM
AS400 tokem ring solution

Mesh

redundancy

Cables
Coaxial
	Copper, low resistance
	10Base2
	10Base5
	10 = speed of transmition
	base = broadband
	2 = meters (185) meters
	5 = meters (400) meters
	10Base2 uses bnc connectors
	-t connector
		-conneccts pc while extending distance
		-looks like a t
	-barrell connecter
		-connect two pcs together
		-looks like a barrell
	-10Base5 connectors use AUI connector
		serial ports 
		parallell ports
	-10BaseT
		-twist pair
	-100BaseT
	-1000BaseT

UTP - unshielded twisted pair
	rj11 - 4 wires, DSL
	rJ-45 - 8 wires, cable modem
	Crosstalk causes singals to mix so RJ -45 uses UTP to reduce
STP - protects from emi. 
	10BaseFX - fiber optics -10 speed base boadband, f = fiber x = not finalized
	able to travel long ditance bute expensive and fragile
	LEDs
	- purified plastic, more durable, lower cost but lower transmission rate
